MultibandLensMMD takes MultibandMMD and isomaps and takes the second step towards real data by adding a realistic Sersic lens in the middle. The model performance is retained, and the lens light addition does not cause any issues. A few runs are then done with lenses having varied colors (rgb magnitudes are not the same), and the model performance even improves slightly. The next step towards real data is taken in RealMMD. train_utils.py holds important functions to reduce clutter in the Jupyter notebooks.
