MultibandMMD contains the modified code which takes FiducialMMD and turns it into a model that works on a 3-band dataset. In order to do so, mb_comment is a notebook that contains comments describing the code from start to finish, as well as some docstrings for functions - the notebook that I used to understand fully the MMD code. Some of the docstrings are generated by AI. mb_fid is the first multiband fiducial notebook. mb_isomap includes the first implementation of isomaps in MMD to visualize DA progress. train_utils.py holds important functions to reduce clutter in the Jupyter notebooks.
