RealMMD takes MultibandLensMMD and uses real data from the delve_source and delve_target configs. The most realistic simulated data possible is generated in delve_source, and delve_target uses real backgrounds on simulated lenses. Though model performance drops, it is significantly better using DA on real data than without. train_utils.py holds important functions to reduce clutter in the Jupyter notebooks, and is updated here.
