MVE_buggy/ contains all fails of MVE runs. The difference between all runs v2 onwards is changes in hyperparameter optimization. Bugs in the hyperparameter code I've written are replaced with _bug. For eaxmple, in v3 and v4, there is a bug in the beta evolution where it evolves half as fast as intended and then jumps to 0.3 or 0.4 at 50% of the epochs, resulting in the model failing. For all runs, we save a best R2 score model, and a best MVE model (v4 onward). Until v5, the best MVE model actually did not save the best MVE model. This caused confusion and inconsistent results. A new MVE folder was started with cleaner code and a clean slate: MVE/.
