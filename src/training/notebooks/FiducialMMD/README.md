FiducialMMD contains fiducial runs as identical to Megan and Paxson's Paper as possible, with the only variations being the data itself. The fidcheck notebooks ensure the reproducibility of Megan and Paxson's results with new deeplenstronomy datasets which may have slight deviations from the original datasets in the paper in case config files do not match precisely. The results are shown to indeed be reproducible with these new datasets.
