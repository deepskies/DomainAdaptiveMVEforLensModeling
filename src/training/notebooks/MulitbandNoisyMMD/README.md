MultibandNoisyMMD takes MultibandMMD and isomaps and takes the first step towards real data by adding significant noise. The noise turns out to be unrealisitically high, so this is not a great check of the applicability of the model on real data. The next step towards real data is taken in MultibandLensMMD train_utils.py holds important functions to reduce clutter in the Jupyter notebooks.
